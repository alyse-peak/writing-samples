# writing-samples

The writing samples in this portfolio display a few of the documentation types I've worked with and writing styles I've used throughout my career. These samples include:

* **Lab guides**: These guides correspond with course videos that help cloud students practice hands-on learning objectives in live sandbox environments. 
* **Product updates**: These documents are geared toward customers and use a conversational tone to provide product release updates. 
* **Infographics**: These documents help customers navigate specific processes within software platforms.
